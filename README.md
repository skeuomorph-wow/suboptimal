### Phase 2
Skeu breaks last egg
Mints OT and should get threat on conflag
Position facing away from casters, casters under columns

## Vael

Mints MT, planning for only tank. (W1 Skeu will build 2nd threat).

Melee to other side. Don't go past Mints, LIP if you have to.

## Dragonkin Packs

Mathelot distracting shot on captain, pull to Vael room. Maybegay and Coldstew spam hibernate on Wyrmkin.

Tanks:
Mints: Warlock 1 ( :skull: )
Skeu: Warlock 2 (:x: )
Bebu: Overseer ( :star: )
Maddimar: Spellbinder 1 ( :crescent_moon: )
Glad: Spellbinder 2 ( :blue_square: )

## Broodlord
Mints start hard, Skeu a few seconds behind. Ideally mints eats first knock away. Bebu also building threat. Position in corner. OTs just to the side, try to get cleaved but not parried.

Raid takes down any remaining whelps, then positions by doorway. 

Bebu applies demo shout (TODO note: not you mints for faster threat?). No CoR if tanks don't have wbuffs.

TODO Note: are we still doing in and out on blast wave or nah?

## Lab Packs (in progress)

Mathelot distracting techies, mcroy and cheefan each take a warlock.

LoS as much as possible, goal is to separate warlocks from techs

When separate, tanks go in on warlocks. Twoteez runs into techs and starts AE and running in a circle.

Ranged starts on techs at 3 AE. Melee on warlocks immediately.

Tanks:
Mints: Warlock 1 ( :skull: )
Skeu: Warlock 2 (:x: )
Bebu: Overseer ( :star: )
Maddimar: Spellbinder 1 ( :crescent_moon: )
Glad: Spellbinder 2 ( :blue_square: )

## Firemaw

Diagram of new spot, assignments, manage stacks call out

## Wyrmguard Packs

2 tanks on skull, one on others, with two tanks playing goalie for ranged/healers.

Shot caller to call out spins and redirect melee. Can also call vulnerability

## other drakes?

Mints MT, Skeu/Bebu OT. Ebonroc, taunt on Shadow of Ebonroc. Flamegor, pre-taunt wing buffet.

Hunters tranq shot. TODO note: rotation?

## Chrom

Mints MT, Skeu building threat for first round of breaths then switching to cat if no time lapse.

DPS, if you don't wanna die, stay behind Skeu for first 2 breaths.

## Nef

Mage/lock start sides
Melee group number sides
Tank assignments

Nef position diagram?
Call strats? (Rogue turn is only real one I guess, anything for mages?)
