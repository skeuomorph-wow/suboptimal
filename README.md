Rogues, try not to use vanish, as we're moving into Vael quicker and you need it there.

### Phase 2
* Skeu breaks last egg
* Mints OT and should get threat on conflag
* Positioned facing into the orb spot, casters don't have to move from the center, just spread out.

## Vael

Mints MT, planning for only tank. (W1 Skeu will build 2nd threat).

Melee to other side. Don't go past Mints.

**LIPs DON'T RESET OR STOP THREAT.** If you LIP but don't slow down, you'll just pull when the LIP wears off.

## Dragonkin Packs

Mathelot distracting shot on captain, pull to Vael room. Maybegay and Coldstew spam hibernate on Wyrmkin.

Tanks:
* Mints: Seether 1 ( :skull: )
* Skeu: Seether 2 or Flamescale 2 ( :x: )
* Clad: Flamescale 1 ( :blue_square: )
* Maddimar: Wyrmkin 1 ( :crescent_moon: ) 
* Bebu: Wyrmkin 2 or Flamescale 2 ( :star: )

## Broodlord
Mints start hard, Skeu a few seconds behind. Ideally mints eats first knock away. Clad also building threat. Position in corner. OTs just to the side, try to get cleaved but not parried.

Raid takes down any remaining whelps, then positions by doorway. 

Clad applies demo shout. No CoR if tanks don't have wbuffs.

## Lab Packs

Mathelot distracting techies, Cheefan ( :skull:) and Babu ( :x: ) each take a warlock.

LoS as much as possible, goal is to separate warlocks from techs

When separate, tanks go in on warlocks. Twoteez runs into techs and starts AE and running in a circle.

Ranged starts on techs at 3 AE. Melee on warlocks immediately.

Tanks:
* Mints: Warlock 1 ( :skull: )
* Skeu: Warlock 2 ( :x: )
* Clad: Overseer ( :blue_square: )
* Maddimar: Spellbinder 1 ( :crescent_moon: )
* Bebu: Spellbinder 2 ( :star: )

## Firemaw

Trying a new strategy to help prevent healer damage/stacks and cut out tank swaps.
Old strategy was "gate", new strategy is "doorway".

Mints will pull, back him in, and then run through to flip, so boss is facing into lab.

Skeu will taunt 6-8 seconds before wing buffet hits.
If Skeu is resisted Bebu will taunt. If that's resisted, Skeu will AOE, then Bebu AOE (that'd be wild).

Once one tank has aggro, pre wing buffet, the other should try and leave.
Firemaw will most likely shadowflame the OT before wing buffeting, so only hitting one is preferred.

After wing buffet firemaw should return to MT without issue.
MT can taunt if needed.

DPS watch your stacks and heal yourself.

## Wyrmguard Packs

2 tanks on skull, one on others, with two tanks playing goalie for ranged/healers. Goalie runs and taunts loose mob back to tank and resets.

* Mints: ( :skull: )
* Skeu: ( :x: )
* Clad: ( :blue_square: )
* Maddimar: ( :skull: )
* Bebu: Goalie, hanging out with ranged.

Shot caller to call out spins and redirect melee. Can also call vulnerability

## Other Drakes

Mints MT, Skeu/Clad OT. Ebonroc, taunt on Shadow of Ebonroc. Flamegor, pre-taunt wing buffet. Hunters tranq shot.

Position them in the corner, MT tucked into the corner, with OTs on either side ready to taunt. This way we don't have to have an OT bouncing back and forth between spots. [Video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/596152667?t=0h42m36s)

## Chrom

Mints MT, Skeu building threat for first round of breaths then switching to cat if no time lapse.

DPS, if you don't wanna die, stay behind Skeu for first 2 breaths.

Hunters tranq shot.

## Nef

Mages start left, lock start right switch if needed

Melee - Odds left, Evens right

Healers LoS fear with pillar.
