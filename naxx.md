Will be facing OTs, then MT isn't getting parried, and less parry hasting from melee


## Loatheb

For loatheb, we should alternate healer types cause you can batch an instant heal at the end. So pws/renew and rejuv. But you don't want to clip the previous healer. Fill in pallies maybe?

## Heigan
Also, not that we have them ( :crying_cat_face: ) but hunter flare can be good to mark zone 2 safe spot during the heigan dance. It's super small and screws people. Any other marker type things people and think of?
