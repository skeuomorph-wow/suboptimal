## Anub
Remember to spread out
FAPs for OTs, melee recommended too

## Post Anub Trash
- All mages/locks blast 1-2 acolytes on pull: https://youtu.be/CJ09N69TbC8?t=1140

## Faerline
Widow's embrace once right away, it stops the AoE nature damage

# Construct

## First Trash
FAPs for tanks, green guys AoE stun

## Patchwork

### Pull
The hardest part: https://youtu.be/HJ3IyBQPOAo?t=1793

Tanks do something to get on threat table, (I'm going to FFF) but don't hit him for a second or two.
Melee even slower than that.

### Positioning

Will be facing OTs, then MT isn't getting parried, and less parry hasting from melee


## Thaddius

Don't demonic rune or sapper when we're actually on Thaddius, big rip

# Plague

## Heigan
Also, not that we have them ( :crying_cat_face: ) but hunter flare can be good to mark zone 2 safe spot during the heigan dance. It's super small and screws people. Any other marker type things people and think of?

## Loatheb

For loatheb, we should alternate healer types cause you can batch an instant heal at the end. So pws/renew and rejuv. But you don't want to clip the previous healer. Fill in pallies maybe?


# General Ref

## Good PTR vods
The PTR buffs is nuts, so lots of the actual stuff they do doesn't apply, but they talk through pulls and strategies
